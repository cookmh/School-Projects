// NOTE: They keywords in the file have already been preprocessed (e.g. to remove punctuation),
//       so you do not have to do that here.
// PARAMETERS:
//   input - An input stream from which keywords and weights are read. For this project, we
//           assume the input stream is a file input stream, where the file format is that
//           provided in the project specification.
//   keywords - An "output parameter", passed by reference, into which the keywords are stored.
//   weights - An "output parameter", passed by reference, into which the weights are stored.

// PARAMETERS:
//   input - An input stream from which the review is read. For this project, we assume the
//           input stream is a file input stream, with words separated by whitespace.and weights are read.
//   reviewWords - An "output parameter", passed by reference, into which the review words are stored.

// and if this happens it's weight is added in multiple times as well. The keywords and their
// corresponding weights are provided as vector parameters. It is assumed that these are parallel
// vectors, so that weights[i] is the weight of keywords[i]. If a word does not appear in the
// keywords vector, its weight is zero.
// HINT: Make a copy of the reviewWords vector using a separate variable. Then, call the
//       preprocessReview() function on the copy. Having a preprocessed copy of the words
//       will allow you to compare against the keywords.
